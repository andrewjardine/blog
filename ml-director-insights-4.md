### [Javier Mansilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javimansilla/?originalSubdomain=ar) - Director of Machine Learning, Marketing Science at [Mercado Libre](https://mercadolibre.com/)

**Background:** During the last 3 years building the internal ML platform for Mercado Libre (NASDAQ MELI), the biggest company in Latam, and the eCommerce & fintech omnipresent solution for the continent. Seasoned entrepreneur and leader, Javier was co-founder and CTO of Machinalis, a hi-end company building Machine Learning since 2010 (yes, before the breakthrough of neuralnets). When Machinalis got acquired by Mercado Libre, that small team evolved to enable Machine Learning as a capability for a tech giant with more 10k devs, impacting the lives of almost 100 million direct users. On a daily basis, Javier leads not only the tech and product roadmap of their Machine Learning Platform, but also their users' tracking system, the AB Testing framework, and the open-source office. Javier is an active member & contributor of [Python-Argentina non-profit PyAr](https://www.python.org.ar/), loves hanging out with family and friends, python, biking, football, carpentry, and slow-paced holidays in nature!

**Fun Fact:** I love reading science fiction, and my idea of retirement includes resuming the teenager dream of writing short stories.üìö

**Mercado Libre:** An Argentine company that operates online marketplaces dedicated to e-commerce and online auctions, including mercadolibre.com.
 
#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on e-commerce?**
I would say that ML made possible the impossible in a few cases (like fraud prevention in general) and in the vast majority of the others, optimized processes and flows in ways we wouldn't immagine.

In the middle, there are applications where ML enabled a next-level of UX that otherwise would be very expensive (but maybe not impossible). An example, the discovery and serendipity added to the journey of users navigating between listings and offers.

We ran search, recommendations, ads, credit-scoring, moderations, forecasting of several key aspects, logistics, and lot‚Äôs more core units with Machine Learning optimizing at least one of its fundamental metrics.

We even use ML for optimizing the way we reserve and use infrastructure.


#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within e-commerce?**
Besides all the technical challenges ahead (for instance, more and more realtimeness and personalization), I think that the biggest challenge is the always present focus on the end-user.

E-commerce is scaling its share on the market year after year, and Machine Learning is always a probabilistic approach that doesn't provide 100% perfection. We need to be careful to keep optimizing our products at the same time that we still pay attention to the long tail and the experience of each individual person.

Finally, a growing challenge is to coordinate and foster the co-existence of data (inputs and outps) in a multi channel and multi business world. Marketplace, logistics, credits, insurtech, payments on brick and mortar stores, etc.


#### **3. A common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into e-commerce?**
The most common mistakes I see are related to using the wrong tool for the wrong problem. 
  
For instance, starting complex instead of with the simplest baseline possible. For instance not measuring the with/without machine learning impact. For instance, investing in tech without having a clear clue of the boundaries of the expected gain.

At last but not least: thinking only on the short term, forgetting about the hidden impacts, technical debts, maintenance, and so on.


#### **4. What excites you most about the future of ML?**
Talking from the perspective of being on the trench crafting technology with our bare hands like we used to do ten years ago, definitely what I like the most is to see that we as an industry are solving most of the slow, repetitive and boring pieces of the challenge.

It‚Äôs of course an ever-moving target, and new difficulties arose.
But we are getting better to incorporate mature tools and practices that will lead to shorter cycles of model-building, which at the end of the day reduces time to market.

#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on Engineering?**

Engineering is vast in its applications and can encompass a great many areas.  That said, more recently we are seeing ML affect a range of engineering facets addressing obvious fields such as robotics and automobile engineering to not-so-obvious fields such as chemical and civil engineering.  ML is so broad in its application that merely the very existence of training data consisting of prior recorded labor processes is all that‚Äôs required to make an attempt at having ML affect your bottom line.  In essence, we are in an age where ML has made a tremendous impact in bringing about automation of all sorts of previously human-only operated engineering processes.

 
#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within Engineering?**
1. In my opinion , the biggest challenges come in  with the operationalization and deployment of ML trained solutions in a manner in which human operation can be replaced with minimal consequences.  We‚Äôre seeing it now with full self-driving automobiles.   It‚Äôs very difficult to automate processes with little to no fear of putting humans or processes that humans rely on in jeopardy.  One of the biggest examples of this phenomenon that concerns me is ML and Bias.  It is a reality that ML models trained on data containing, even if unaware, prejudiced decision making can reproduce said bias in operation.  Bias needs to be put front and center in the attempt to incorporate ML into engineering such that systemic racism isn‚Äôt propagated into future technological advances to then cause harm to disadvantaged populations.  ML systems trained on data emanating from biased processes are doomed to repeat them.  Particularly if those who are training the ML solutions aren‚Äôt acutely aware of all forms of data present in the process to be automated.

2. Another key challenge I see regarding ML in engineering is that the field is mainly categorized by the need for problem solving, which often requires creativity.  As of now, few great cases exist today of ML agents being truly ‚Äúcreative‚Äù and capable of ‚Äúthinking out-of-the-box‚Äù since current ML solutions tend to result merely from a search through all possible solutions.  In my humble opinion, though a great many solutions can be found via these methods, ML will have somewhat of a ceiling in engineering until the former can consistently demonstrate creativity in a variety of problem spaces.  That said, that ceiling is still pretty high and there is much left to be accomplished in ML applications in engineering.


 
#### **3. What‚Äôs a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into Engineering?**
Using an overpowered ML technique on a small problem dataset is one common mistake I see people doing in integrating ML into Engineering.  Deep Learning, for example, is moving AI and ML to heights unimagined in such a short period, but it may not be one‚Äôs best method for solving a problem depending on your problem space.  Oftentimes simpler methods work just as well or better  when you are working with small training datasets on limited hardware.

Also, not setting up an effective CI/CD (continuous integration/ continuous  deployment) structure for your ML solution is another mistake I see practitioners use.  Very often, a once trained model won‚Äôt suffice not only because data changes over time but resources and personnel do as well.  Today‚Äôs ML practitioner needs to
1. secure consistent flow of data as it changes and continuously retrain new models to keep it accurate and useful,  
2. ensure structure is in place to allow for seamless replacement of older models by newly trained models while, 
3. allowing for minimal disruption to the consumer of the ML model outputs.


 
#### **4. What excites you most about the future of ML?**
The future of ML continues to be exciting and seemingly every month there are advances reported in the field that even wow the experts to this day.  As 1) ML techniques improve and become more accessible to established practitioners and novices alike, 2) everyday hardware becomes faster,  3) power consumption becomes less problematic for miniaturized edge devices, and 4) memory limitations diminish over time, the ceiling for ML in Engineering will be bright for years to come.
