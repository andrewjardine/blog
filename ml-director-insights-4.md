### [Javier Mansilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javimansilla/?originalSubdomain=ar) - Director of Machine Learning, Marketing Science at [Mercado Libre](https://mercadolibre.com/)

**Background:** During the last 3 years building the internal ML platform for Mercado Libre (NASDAQ MELI), the biggest company in Latam, and the eCommerce & fintech omnipresent solution for the continent. Seasoned entrepreneur and leader, Javier was co-founder and CTO of Machinalis, a hi-end company building Machine Learning since 2010 (yes, before the breakthrough of neuralnets). When Machinalis got acquired by Mercado Libre, that small team evolved to enable Machine Learning as a capability for a tech giant with more 10k devs, impacting the lives of almost 100 million direct users. On a daily basis, Javier leads not only the tech and product roadmap of their Machine Learning Platform, but also their users' tracking system, the AB Testing framework, and the open-source office. Javier is an active member & contributor of [Python-Argentina non-profit PyAr](https://www.python.org.ar/), loves hanging out with family and friends, python, biking, football, carpentry, and slow-paced holidays in nature!

**Fun Fact:** I love reading science fiction, and my idea of retirement includes resuming the teenager dream of writing short stories.ðŸ“š

**Mercado Libre:** An Argentine company that operates online marketplaces dedicated to e-commerce and online auctions, including mercadolibre.com.
 
#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on e-commerce?**
I would say that ML made possible the impossible in a few cases (like fraud prevention in general) and in the vast majority of the others, optimized processes and flows in ways we wouldn't immagine.

In the middle, there are applications where ML enabled a next-level of UX that otherwise would be very expensive (but maybe not impossible). An example, the discovery and serendipity added to the journey of users navigating between listings and offers.

We ran search, recommendations, ads, credit-scoring, moderations, forecasting of several key aspects, logistics, and lotâ€™s more core units with Machine Learning optimizing at least one of its fundamental metrics.

We even use ML for optimizing the way we reserve and use infrastructure.


#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within e-commerce?**
Besides all the technical challenges ahead (for instance, more and more realtimeness and personalization), I think that the biggest challenge is the always present focus on the end-user.

E-commerce is scaling its share on the market year after year, and Machine Learning is always a probabilistic approach that doesn't provide 100% perfection. We need to be careful to keep optimizing our products at the same time that we still pay attention to the long tail and the experience of each individual person.

Finally, a growing challenge is to coordinate and foster the co-existence of data (inputs and outps) in a multi channel and multi business world. Marketplace, logistics, credits, insurtech, payments on brick and mortar stores, etc.


#### **3. A common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into e-commerce?**
The most common mistakes I see are related to using the wrong tool for the wrong problem. 
  
For instance, starting complex instead of with the simplest baseline possible. For instance not measuring the with/without machine learning impact. For instance, investing in tech without having a clear clue of the boundaries of the expected gain.

At last but not least: thinking only on the short term, forgetting about the hidden impacts, technical debts, maintenance, and so on.


#### **4. What excites you most about the future of ML?**
Talking from the perspective of being on the trench crafting technology with our bare hands like we used to do ten years ago, definitely what I like the most is to see that we as an industry are solving most of the slow, repetitive and boring pieces of the challenge.

Itâ€™s of course an ever-moving target, and new difficulties arose.
But we are getting better to incorporate mature tools and practices that will lead to shorter cycles of model-building, which at the end of the day reduces time to market.
